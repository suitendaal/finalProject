# Style guide

* Try to make functions not longer then 15 lines.
* Put functions in classes if possible to keep the actual code short and clear.
* When you got code from the internet, give the source of this code in a comment on top of the function the code is written in.
* Furthermore only use comments to explain why you do something.
* Start comments in capital and end them with a dot.
* Give variables names so that it is clear what you use them for.
* Don't use the same code in 2 different functions, make a function to run this specific code.
* Sort functions in alphabetical order.
* On top of each activity, write down what this activity does.
* On top of each class, write down what this class is for.

## API's and frameworks

* [GENIUS API](https://genius.com/api-clients). I will use this API to search for song and artists. I get a maximum of 10 results back, containing among others the name, the artist and the url to the webpage with lyrics. If the user clicks on the song I will strip this html page until I only keep the lyrics.
* [MediaRecorder](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediarecorder.html) on the device. I will use this to record the users voice when he is using the app to make a cover.
* [MediaPlayer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer.html) on the device. I will use it to play the recorded music.

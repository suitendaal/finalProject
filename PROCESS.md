# Day 1

Retrieved songs from API. HTML with lyrics is shown into the app.
Requests the user to record and play audio and read and write in the internal storage.
Audio can be recorded but not yet be played.

# Day 2

More classes where created to clean up the code. Audio can be recorded and played. 
Only problem yet is when a user installs the application the app crashes until the user has given permission to record audio and write internal storage.

# Day 3

Permission request fixed. Several audio files can be recorded.

# Day 4

Audio can be looped when recorded, max duration time set. Lyrics retrieved.

# Day 5

Failed to save audio files as one audio file.

# Day 6

Same as day 5.

# Day 7

Found a solution to the problem of day 5 and 6. When a user saves his recording a directory is created with a name chosen by the user. All of the samples are copied to this directory.

# Day 8

Made some dialogframes. The one for the seekbar for playing audio does not work yet.

# Day 9

Got material design icons for some functions in the app.

# Day 10

Created background and style for background and buttons.

# Day 11

Commented the whole code and fixed some bugs.
